# ToDoAppAngular
>  An Angular 5 Example App, built while I was learning Angular.

## Firebase
- Currently the app is hosted on Firebase Web Hosting.
  **Live Demo**, <a href="https://todo-example-app.com">Check it out here!</a>

## Overview:
- The App is basically a TO-DO app where a user is able to add tasks to their task list, and is able to prioritize certain tasks, look at the chart implemented from ng-charts for more motivation and insight, and a user can remove a task as well as set a task to 'done' and they will be able to see all the changes go through the chart as well.

## Features
- I have used <a href="https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-charts">ngCharts</a> for the pie chart.
- I used **Event-Emitters** for Cross-Component Communications, implemented alongside **Services**
- Properly implemented **Services and Dependency Injections**.
- Several **Data & Event Bindings** were implemented.
- Also **Two-Way binding** was done for adding new tasks.

## Implementation
- I used **Angular cli** ver 1.6.4 (Angular 5)
- I used **Twitter Bootstrap 3** & **Font-Awesome**.
